                <p>Hi! My name is Janey and I currently work on research and product strategy at Studio Subu, a design and communications studio in Mumbai. </p>

                <p>My interests lie in the intersection of product design and international development (particularly financial inclusion). I believe empathy, inclusivity, and good design can play an instrumental role in service delivery. </p>

                <p>I was previously a fellow with the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy’s International Innovation Corps. I introduced user-centered design to a project with the Tata Trusts and Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai  to improve sanitation and waste management in the city.</p>

                <p>Even before that, I analyzed a bunch of data for the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It was there I realized that financial services and financial inclusion are areas ripe for user-centered thinking and thoughtful product design.</p>

                <p>I hold a Bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Chicago, where I took many excellent courses in policy, law, anthropology, and statistics.</p>
