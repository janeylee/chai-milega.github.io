            <p>Working with Ummeed Child Development Center has been one of my favorite projects in my short design career. This project taught me how something as intangible as empathy for parents of children experiencing developmental disabilities could translate onto the web.
        
            </p>
            <p>Our website redesign project with Ummeed began, as usual, with several weeks of research with the organization's team. We spoke not only to doctors, pediatricians, and therapists, but also to parents of children served at Ummeed. We soon found that the website was a great avenue to showcase Ummeed's warm, caring approach with families - and this translated into many of the design and product decisions we made. It was important to constantly keep our audience in mind and make sure that we were using the website and its content empower families with knowledge and assurance.</p>
