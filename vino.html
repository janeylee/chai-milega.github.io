        <h2>Membership onboarding flow for a wine club</h2>
        <p><b>My role: UI, visual, and interaction designer</b></p>
        
        <p>VINO is a wine club that brings together wine enthusiasts and artisan producers. By purchasing a yearly membership, VINO members have access to an exclusive selection of artisan wine, free master classes with winemakers, and community events. </p>
        
        <p>I designed a membership onboarding flow for VINO's app and desktop screens. </p>

        <h2>Design challenge</h2>
        <p>Design a membership onboarding flow that converts 500 wine enthusiasts into VINO club members within the first quarter of launching the web and mobile platforms.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>1. Research</h2>
        <p><b>Competitive analysis</b></p>
        <p>I explored the features, design, and messaging of several other wine shops/clubs, including Vinebox, Winc, Tasting Room, Pour This, and Plonk. Some insights: </p>
        
        
        
        <ul>
            <li>Other wine clubs are more focused the wine bottle itself, not the people you would meet.</li>
            <li>Most wine clubs are targeted towards millenials, as older customers have different buying behaviors.</li>
            <li>Wine clubs try to make buying wine a more customized experience by asking customers what they like during their onboarding flow.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <img src="images/vinocase6.jpg">
        
        <p><b>User research</b></p>
        <p>Before designing, I conducted a user research study with our target audience to determine:</p>
        
         <ul>
            <li>What value do people currently gain from wine clubs? </li>
            <li>What are the main advantages, as well as pain points, of belonging to a wine club? </li>
            <li>What are people’s behavior patterns around consuming or gifting wine?</li>
            <li>What are people’s behavior patterns around buying wine online vs. in shops? 
</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>
        <h2>2. Key insights</h2>
        <p>The insights from my research turned into the following principles, which I kept in mind throughout designing given the brief, my research, and past experience.
</p>
        <img src="images/vinocase8.jpg">
<!--
        <ul>
            <li><b>Provide value to the user before asking them to do anything. </b>Allow users to see/experience a VINO membership before signing up.
</li>
            <li><b>Focus messaging and design on VINO’s main value proposition: community and inclusiveness. </b> These are more important than periphery benefits like cost transparency and shipping.</li>
            <li><b>Target a millennial consumer audience that loves to share. </b> Successful wine clubs have recently pivoted to cater to a growing millennial, photo-sharing “Generation Me” audience.</li>
        </ul>
-->
        
            
        <br>
        <h2>3. UX</h2>
        <p>Keeping my design principles in mind, I first wrote the story/flow I wanted to take the user through on sketches. </p>
        

        <br>
            
        
        <h2>4. Visual exploration</h2>
        <p>After putting a basic structure in place, I explored multiple visual styles along a spectrum between refined/formal/heritage to organic/casual/contemporary. </p>
        <img src="images/vinocase1.png">
        
        <h2>5. Design</h2>
        <p>After putting a basic structure in place, I explored multiple visual styles along a spectrum between refined/formal/heritage to organic/casual/contemporary. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Design style:</b> The organic/casual/contemporary looked most appropriate for VINO’s millennial audience and emphasis on community. </li>
            <li><b>Font and color: </b> In order to maintain a balance between the warmth of VINO’s community and the formality of wine-drinking, I used a wine red accent color and a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts. </li>
            <img src="images/vinocase7.jpg">
            <li><b>Photography: </b> I used photography to depict the human element of VINO’s community in a relatable, believable way.</li>
            <li><b>Copy: </b>  Given VINO’s value proposition, my copy is intended to be conversational, inclusive, and welcoming. 
            

            
</li>
        </ul>
